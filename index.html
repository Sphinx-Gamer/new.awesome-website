<p>It has been a half a year of messing around and dealing with life stuff, but beginning today, July 9th, 2016. I am putting my foot down... I am devoting myself to getting the new Sphinx Gamer website up and running by the end of the year. No excuses. Through textbooks ordered on Amazon and learning web design through Treehouse, I am putting myself to work and plan on making my website. No Wordpress this time like the first first I had last year, no. I want to create something that will be fresh, memorable, and really something that I can be proud of and that can be a real cool website on the net. At first, it will be crap. Chances are it will be, I'm building it from scratch and I am an amateur. But I hope overtime, I can build upon it and really make it shine.   </p>

<a id="rebranding" class="anchor" href="#rebranding" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rebranding</h2>

<p>I plan on rebranding the blog and brand over time, either in the next few months or by the time the new site launches at the end of the year. First, there are way too many people out there named "Sphinx Gamer", I hate that. I had that name down back in 2014 when I created it. Second, while video games is a passion of mine it is not the only one; Motorsports, and Travel are also up there and I'd love to showcase my interest and photos of that stuff on the site. So with that I'm going to be changing the name which will be revealed soon in the next few months. I'm experimenting with new names and colors to see what will work.</p>

<p>Come on by and follow what's happening via Twitter - @Sphinx_Gamer or on Facebook! I'm not looking for any help with this, but occasionally I might post something on here for some feedback. I want to make the new site as cool as it can be!</p>
