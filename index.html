<p>It has been a half a year of messing around and dealing with life stuff, but beginning today, July 9th, 2016. I am putting my foot down... I am devoting myself to making a career change from hospitality and not feeling fulfilled with what I do to making something of value and to a new career of programming and design.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what-ive-done" class="anchor" href="#what-ive-done" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I've Done</h2>

<p>I'd love to get my new blog, The new Sphinx Gamer website up and running by the end of the year. No excuses. Through textbooks ordered on Amazon and learning web design through Treehouse, I am putting myself to work and plan on making my website. I want to create something that will be fresh, memorable, and really something that I can be proud of and that can be a real cool website on the net. At first, it will be crap. Chances are it will be, I'm building it from scratch and I am an amateur. But I hope overtime, I can build upon it and really make it shine. I started the Sphinx Gamer brand back in 2014 with a rudimentary blog running off WordPress. Additionally, there is a YouTube channel associated with it as well, along with additional social media presence on Twitter - @sphinx_gamer, Facebook, Google +, Instagram, and Pinterest.  </p>

<h2>
<a id="moving-forward" class="anchor" href="#moving-forward" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>I plan on rebranding the blog and brand over time, either in the next few months or by the time the new site launches. 
First though, I'm teaching myself development skills through Treehouse as well as great textbooks I've got at home. I'm devoted to finding additional opportunities through unpaid internships or volunteer opportunities that can allow me to expand my skill set and to give some real work experience. </p>

<a id="in-the-mean-time" class="anchor" href="#in-the-mean-time" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>In the mean time...</h3>

<p>I"ll be investing my time into self-improvement and learning projects in the hopes to eventually end up where I want to be!</p>
